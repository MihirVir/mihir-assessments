Data.txt is a text file containing a list of random strings
SearchTerms.txt is a text file containing a list of search terms

What is the average number of lines found in Data.txt that contain a search term?

For any one of the search terms there will be a number of lines in 
Data.txt that contain that search term.

We want the average number of lines of Data.txt for all the 
search terms in the SearchTerm file. Find the total 
number lines of data.txt which have one or more 
occurrences of each search item, add it up and then find 
the average lines by dividing it by the count of searchItems.
